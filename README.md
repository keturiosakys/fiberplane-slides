# Fiberplane theme - reveal.js powered by Vite

This is a Fiberplane theme for using the [reveal.js](https://www.revealjs.com) HTML slides framework.

The template allows writing the entire deck in markdown using `---` as slide separators, adding text, images, and code and renders the final output in a `dist` folder that can be deployed as a static site.

## How to get started

1. Pull down the repo
2. Install the dependencies `npm i`
3. Run `npm run dev` to write your deck locally
4. Run `npm run build` to create a finalized deck in a `dist` folder that can be deployed as a static site.
